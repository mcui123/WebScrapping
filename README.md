# WebScrapping
World Health, Education and Economy Data Visualization: A Web Scrapping Project


Included are: 
1) Python code (ipynb) for scrapping data off CIA World Factbook 
2) A big R file that houses majority of codes for plotting 
3) "correlation_plots.R" A seperate R code that houses additional codes for plotting and a large amount of scatterplot for correlation studies (which was later not used in final powerpoint)
4) "correlation plot_heatmap.R" A seperate R code that houses additional codes for plotting a correlation heatmap (was decided to be a better presentation that scatterplots, and was used in final powerpoint)
5) A Power Point Slide Deck for presentation 
6) A CSV file that is the result from web scrapping
